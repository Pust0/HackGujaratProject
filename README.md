### The problem CodeConnect solves<br>

1.Interviews made easier
Online interviews are increasing exponentially now as everything is becoming digital. It is very inconvenient when using screen share during interviews and Nobody likes writing code on a whiteboard.So Codeconnect resolves this issues by providing a platform where both code and interview can go simultaneously in real time.

2.Efficient teaching
As the era of remote development is coming to life in this time of pandemic, so is the era of online learning. Many platforms such as google meet and zoom are being used for teaching. But let’s say I have a doubt I want to ask regarding code. Either the teacher has to share their screen or I have to do it. And it’s very inconvenient when someone has to explain something in terms of code without actually writing it. The teacher can be sharing their screen and going through the code but it would be very hard for the student to intercept their doubts in the code through talking.As both of them are not in the same room and cannot explain their doubts on a single device. It becomes difficult for the teacher to explain things and even more difficult for the student to understand unless they both can work at the same time.We are facing problems like these everyday. So what we are trying to achieve is that both the clients can work on the code at the exact same time(i.e in real time) and compile it then and there. This not only solves the problem of miscommunication and errors but increases efficient learning.

3.Problem of Creating Multiple redundant versions
Let’s say, a group of us friends have been given an assignment. We have to submit it in code. So I write a document and I assume it’s final and I send it. My friends on the other hand find out there are multiple errors, so I write a document again. This time is final. Now they figure out a better solution, so I change it again. It’s definitely the final_final_document. And they change it again
